I'm learning the basics of C # programming language. A few days ago I have a Tic Tac Toe implementation written in C #. Once I have this implemented in addition to C ++ with QT4 I chose an AI to attack, because it permanently is quite boring to play against himself. The AI â��â��works on the principle that it knows all the possibilities. It selects all possible trains the train that has the highest probability of winning and your opponent brings her the slightest chance to win. If it is no longer possible to win according to achieve a draw starting with the target. Below the videos are the sources or the C # project file all the necessary programs to download. Since I have not yet know how I in C # programs resources einbette # version of the entire project folder is to carry out the required C. The internal structure of the project folder must not be changed, otherwise the needed helpers are no longer found files for AI!
